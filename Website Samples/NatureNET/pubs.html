Guide to Edit This Page,

1. Copy Paste This Below Indicated to Add A New Publication,

    <div class="main">
    <table class="pubs-table">
        <tr><td>
                <p><img src="PUT IMAGE HERE FOR A PUBLICATION" class="pubs-table-image"</p>

                    </li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>        
    </table>
    <div class="toggle-div" id="toggle-div-first">        
        <ul class="toggle-ul">            
            <li>
              ABSTRACT OF THE PAPER
            </li>
        </ul>        
    </div>
    </div>
   
2.  Each Abstract with plus sign, as you can see on page is uniquely defined in script/custom.js file according to its division number. 
    Please update toggle-*number* corresponding to sequence of div everytime here and in custom.js both.
    Example, if it is your FIFTH publication, then, do like this for "toggle: IDs with numbers,
    a. toggle-fifth
    b. toggle-div-fifth

    Add corresponding div in custom.js also.

                Crowdsourcing design has been applied in various areas of
                graphic design, software design, and product design. This
                paper draws on those experiences and research in diversity,
                creativity, and motivation to present a model for
                crowdsourcing the design of a socio-technical system for a
                citizen science community. NatureNet is a tabletop device
                with several client applications available in a nature park
                setting. Park visitors are encouraged to participate in the
                design of the tasks and the interaction design as well as
                collect bio-diversity data. Crowdsourcing design for citizen
                science of this kind serves two purposes: to increase the
                motivation to participate and to increase creativity through
                diversity of design expertise. This paper presents the theory
                behind our model of crowdsourcing the design of a citizen
                science socio-technical system, the initial design of
                NtureNet system, and results from our initial design studies.
                Our results reinforce our assumptions that crowdsourcing
                design can introduce more diversity of design ideas and
                generate enthusiasm for citizen science.

            Crowdsourcing design has been applied in various areas of graphic design, soft-
            ware design, and product design. This paper draws on those experiences and re-
            search in diversity, creativity and motivation to present a process model for
            crowdsourcing experience design. Crowdsourcing experience design for volunteer
            online communities serves two purposes: to increase the motivation of partici-
            pants by making them stakeholders in the success of the project, and to increase
            the creativity of the design by increasing the diversity of expertise beyond experts
            in experience design. Our process model for crowdsourcing design extends the
            concept of a meta-design architecture in which software for online communities is
            designed to be iteratively re-designed by its users. We describe how our model has
            been deployed and adapted to a citizen science project where nature preserve visi-
            tors can participate in the design of a system called NatureNet. The major contri-
            bution of this paper is a model for crowdsourcing experience design and a case
            study of how we have deployed it for the design and development of NatureNet.
