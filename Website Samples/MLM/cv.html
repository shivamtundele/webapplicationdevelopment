            <!-- Edit Content Here in <p> ... </p> tags -->
             <p>My academic career has taken a path that started in Engineering, through Architecture and Design Computing, 
                and more recently Computer Science and Information Studies. My research and teaching has centered on computational 
                support for design and creativity. My current focus is on issues related to scale: big data and crowdsourcing. With
                big data we can look for patterns and trends that lead to a better understanding of creativity as a combination of 
                novelty, value and surprise. In crowdsourcing, we have the opportunity to study the impact of casual users participating
                in online creative communities, and the impact of knowledge diversity on quality and creativity of designs. I am also 
                interested in how different modes of interaction affect creative cognition and am working on various gesture-based 
                tangible interaction designs.</p>
            <p>Whin 2008 I became a member of Senior Executive
                Services was appointed as Deputy Director of the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems.le at NSF, 2006-2010, I started 
                a funding program CreativeIT and co-chaired the Cyber-Enabled Discovery and Innovation
                Program. I was a Program Director in the Human-Centered Computing Cluster. In 2008 I became a member of Senior Executive
                Services was appointed as Deputy Director of the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems.</p>
            <p>While Professor of Design Computing and Co-Director of the Key Centre of Design Computing and Cognition at the University
                of Sydney, I developed and implemented an innovative Bachelor degree in design computing, I was Chair of the Department
                of Architectural and Design Science, as Co-Director of the Key Center I led a group of 11 academics in developing 
                teaching and research in design computing and cognition, and I taught research methods in the School of Information
                Technology and in Design Computing. I assisted in the development of a research program for the Collaborative Research 
                Centre for Construction Innovation and in the start up of the Humans Understanding Machines group at National ICT 
                Australia.</p>
